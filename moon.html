        <h2 style="color: white;">Travelling at night alone</h2><br>
        <p style="position:relative;padding: 10px;color: white">Travelling alone in daylight is also a thing — which is mostly noisy and busy and tiring. Maybe it’s just that I do that so much that’s given me the appreciation for the quieter night time hours but there is something deeply silent and magical
            about the moment at 3am when all the world is dozing around you. A little of it is the apocalyptic fantasy — that all your problems suddenly disappear because the world is disrupted but nowhere near that aggressive, it’s just that no one else
            is awake. People tend to sleep on night planes and buses — and I do, a bit but there’s an intense pleasure to being awake, surrounded by the peacefulness of slumber. Which is absolutely me romanticising it because in reality, the long hours
            of realising how badly your leg is in pain from the cramped seat, that you can’t move enough to relieve the pressure on a spine that’s had all your luggage on it for several sweaty miles before you got on here.<br><span> None of that is actually pleasant.
            But the almost suffocating drowsy heat of a cabin, surrounded by people you’re very unlikely to see ever again, is a peculiar sort of isolation. It doesn’t feel despairing — you’re in transit, a thing is occurring and you’ve played your part
            in ensuring that by getting on it. Because I’m old, the almost nausea-wave tiredness of true exhaustion, head swimming in the drowning pool of sleep, makes me think of the Manics — I’m running on loneliness — but with that as no bad thing.
            For the anxiously overworked, those moments of full privacy — from intrusive thoughts about work, from the pressure of deadlines, from the nagging feeling you should be doing something - are very rare. To have time to seriously think, for
            anyone, is even moreso.</span></p>
